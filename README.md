# Morra-Game

Morra is an old Italian hand game that dates back thousands of years to ancient Roman and Greek times. The game is quite simple: it is played by two players. Both players simultaneously show a number of fingers (between 1 and 5) and simultaneously call out a guess of the sum of fingers displayed by both players. If a player’s guess is equal to the actual sum, this player scores a point. If both players guess the actual sum neither of them score a point. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined score.

A human player plays against an artificial intelligence (AI), called Jarvis. Morra is a game of chance, but also a game of psychology! The AI will try to learn the behaviour of the human player and attempt to guess the player’s next move.
